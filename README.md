![best_store_logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4772d86-264e-4a55-9815-b782cb2b78ad)

A web-based grocery management system that allows users to search, add, edit, and delete items from a database. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, the application provides a simple, responsive interface for managing grocery inventory.

# 📖 About the Project
The Best Price Groceries project demonstrates the use of web technologies to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with a clean UI and backend database integration.

# Key Features:
- 🔍 Search items by name or ID

- ➕ Add items with name, description, and price

- 📝 Edit items directly from the list (update name, description, price)

- 🗑️ Delete items using a trash icon button

- 📦 Dynamically updated interface powered by JavaScript and AJAX requests

This project showcases skills in front-end UI development, server-side scripting with PHP, and database integration.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🌐 HTML → structure of the interface

- 🎨 CSS → styling and layout

- ⚡ JavaScript → dynamic updates and AJAX requests

# ▶️ How to Use the Project
1- Start a web server (e.g., Apache or XAMPP) and include all project files.

2- Access the project in your browser via the server (e.g., http://localhost/Best-Price-Groceries).

3- Use the interface:

- 🔍 Enter an item name or ID in the search bar to find items.

- ➕ Click “Add Item” to insert a new grocery item. Fill in name, description, and price.

- 📜 View results in the list below the search bar.

- 📝 Use the edit button (pencil icon) to modify an item.

- 🗑️ Use the delete button (trash icon) to remove an item.

- 🖥️ PHP → backend logic and database operations

# ⚙️ How the Project Works

HTML and CSS → define the layout and visual styling.

JavaScript (script.js) → handles dynamic updates and sends POST requests to the backend.

PHP:

   - Database.php → establishes the database connection

   - Service.php → contains all database operations (insert, update, delete, search)

   - Handler.php → receives POST requests and calls appropriate Service.php functions

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

- Designing and styling a responsive web interface

- Using JavaScript for dynamic user interaction and database updates

- Writing PHP backend scripts to handle CRUD operations

- Managing database connectivity with modular PHP scripts

- Building a full-stack CRUD web application from scratch

# 🚀 Future Enhancements

🔑 Add user authentication (login system for admins)

📊 Create analytics dashboard to track item trends

🌍 Add multi-language support

📱 Make the UI fully mobile responsive

🛒 Add categories and filtering (e.g., fruits, dairy, grains)
